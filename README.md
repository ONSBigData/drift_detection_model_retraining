# drift_detection_model_retraining
Drift detection and model retraining methods

All work here is experimental and unfinished and has been done in an attempt to better understand drift, drift detectors and model retraining.

Concept Drift is a first attempt as exploring drift and retraining on the ECOICOP dataset. Some terms may be slightly different than used elsewhere due to this work being done before further research.

Dimension Reduction Concept Drift is the start of looking into creating synthetic drift in a different way.
